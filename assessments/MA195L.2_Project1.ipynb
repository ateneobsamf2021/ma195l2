    "\n",
    "1. Upload the complete Jupyter notebook to the appropriate submission bin in Canvas on or before **May 17, 2021 (Monday) 11:59 PM**.\n",
    "2. Make sure that your notebook is organized, well-documented and clearly-annotated.\n",
    "3. Your notebook should show all the code required for Parts 1, 2, and 3. The answers for Part 2 should be displayed in your Notebook. For questions requiring some analysis/explanation (Part 3), make sure to write your detailed paragraphs (and display your graphs) in [markdown cells](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_markdown_cells.htm). \n",
    "4. The filename for your Jupyter notebook should follow this format: `ma195l2_[lastnameofTeamMember1]_[lastnameofTeamMember2]_Project1.ipynb`\n",
    "5. Include comments (using the # symbol) in the body of your code so that it will be easier for the instructor to understand your code. For your helper functions, write a descriptive [docstring](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/docstrings) similar to the ones below. \n",
    "6. Make sure to indicate in a markdown cell at the start of your notebook your names, as well as the names of the people you have asked help from and the online websites you have used in solving the problem. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Submitted by: Jakov Ivan S. Dumbrique\n",

    "        - Returns the undiversified d-day p% VaR of a portfolio of currencies using Delta Normal Approach\n",
    "        - this should have the option to implement EWMA in estimating volatilities of the exchange-rate returns\n",
    "        - uses the N-day logarithmic returns in calculating N-day VaR \n",
    "2. `diversified_VaR_delta_normal_fx()`\n",
    "        - Returns the diversified d-day p% VaR of a portfolio of currencies using Delta Normal Approach\n",
    "        - when you want to use EWMA for an N-asset portfolio, this function will only calculate the EWMA for a two-asset portfolio\n",
    "        - uses the N-day logarithmic returns in calculating N-day VaR \n",
    "3. `VaR_hs_fx()`\n",
    "        - Returns the d-day p% VaR of a portfolio of currencies using Historical Simulation Approach\n",
    "        - implements the normal HS method (which simulates scenarios on the return of each individual currency), not the \"alternative\" HS method (which runs scenarios on the returns of the entire portfolio)\n",
    "4. `VaR_brw_fx()`\n",
    "        - Returns the d-day p% VaR of a portfolio of currencies using Boudoukh-Richardson-Whitelaw (BRW)  Approach\n",
    "        - similar to `VaR_hs_fx()`, this function implements the normal method (which simulates scenarios on the return of each individual currency), not the \"alternative\" method (which runs scenarios on the returns of the entire portfolio)\n",
    "5. `VaR_cfm_bonds()`\n",
    "        - Returns the d-day p% VaR of a portfolio of bonds using Cash Flow Mapping (CFM)\n",
    "6. `undiversified_VaR_delta_normal_bonds()`\n",
    "        - Returns the undiversified d-day p% VaR of a portfolio of bonds using Delta Normal Approach\n",
    "7. `diversified_VaR_delta_normal_bonds()`\n",
    "        - Returns the diversified d-day p% VaR of a portfolio of bonds using Delta Normal Approach\n",
